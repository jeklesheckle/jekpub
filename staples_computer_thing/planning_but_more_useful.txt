computer.rb defines computer class and methods that manipulate computers

currently: making a method to create computers from the command line.
ISSUE: the elements of processor / os /etc are not defined within the class
FIX: make the method for entering a computer be within the object


next real step:
 = create methods for retrieving computers by trait
	--> methods take an array of computers + [float + comparator] / string / etc + a symbol and find the computers that fit the filter those inputs create
	    e.g. float_lookup(2.0, "greater", :threads) ==> [computer_with_more_than_two_threads, computer_that_has_four_threads]

 = then create a gui that binds user actions (button-presses, etc.) to calls to these methods. if a user wants to have multiple filters you can apply them in series
	--> when "submit" button is pressed, a collection of the values of the inputs is passed to a parser, that parser reads the inputs and calls functions
	    based on those inputs, continuously feeding the input of each function into the next. Once the parser runs out of input, it spits out the remaining
	    array of computers. that array is then usable by an output function which will display the machines that fit the specs.



OVERALL LOOK OF THANGS:

start program
load computers from file into RAM as an array
have a UI that allows user to enter parameters to search for each "thing" in computer.rb

like:

___________________________
processor		  |
base:______    >  =  <	  |
boost:______   >  =  <	  | <------ float lookup
cores:_______		  |

type:______               |  <--- string lookup
