what I want to be able to do:
-filter a list of computers by traits
-compare computers highlighting differences

Getting traits:
-I want to ingest computers by model
  1) enter model name
  2) based on brand, searches a variety of sources for a listing
  3) once a listing, strips all information from the primary source
     then the remaining information from any secondary sources
  4) stores the information inside a file as a line
-also have an option to manually create a listing

Currently working on:
Computer object design --> file management
