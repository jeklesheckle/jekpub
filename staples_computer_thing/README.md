# A tool to manage computer SKUs
While selling computers at Staples, I found that I often lacked information on
the intimate details of some of our models. There was also no way to quickly
compile a list of all of our computers that fit certain criteria. This project
was designed to fix that.

The project is still currently under development and is of no practical use.

At this time, the first version will take computers from the command line and
save them to a file. The user can then search and filter the computers by a
variety of criteria.
[ ] saving computers to file
[ ] find computers with highest / lowest value in a particular aspect
[ ] find all computers with a particular aspect above / below / equal to a
  certain value
[ ] create a UI
[ ] create a web scraper to pull some information about laptops
[ ] add a way to make the scraped data into computer "skeletons" so the user
  can fill in the rest of the data
