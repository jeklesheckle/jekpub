This script literally just takes a file name and a string and spits out a file by that filename with the given string having a space in between each character (except the last one)

# how to use if you know nothing about git
1. Make sure you have ruby installed (this was written in 2.5.2 iirc).
2. Copy the contents of space_out.rb into a new file and save it as *whatever you want*.rb
3. You run by doing ```ruby *your filename*.rb``` (without the * )

# how to use if you know things about git
either you don't need me to tell you or you should use the know nothing about git instructions
