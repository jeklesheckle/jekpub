# Dota 2 Winrate by Side Tracker
Uses the Dota2 WebApi and (insert ruby data visualization tool here) to show a graph of the winrates of the Radiant and Dire in 100 recent matches.

I plan to update it to eventually pull more data and display the images that it generates in a persistent frame.

Please note that if you want to use this code on your own machine you will need to add a file called api_key.txt containing your own personal key. If you copy my .gitignore, that file will be automatically excluded if you decide to share the code elsewhere.
