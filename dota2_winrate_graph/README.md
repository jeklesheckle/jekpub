# Dota 2 Winrate by Side Tracker
Uses the Dota2 WebApi and (insert ruby data visualization tool here) to show a graph of the winrates of the Radiant and Dire in 100 recent matches.
The graph is saved in a file called "winrates.png"

I planned to update it to eventually pull more data and display the images that it generates in a persistent frame, but now I believe I'll work on other projects more pertinent to my career.

Please note that if you want to use this code on your own machine you will need to add a file called api_key.txt containing your own personal key. If you copy my .gitignore, that file will be automatically excluded if you decide to share the code elsewhere.
